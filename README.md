# PetitCoindeParadis

A project done in around 24 hours during a hackathon.

We tried to create a system that would recommend a city you might want to live in, depending on a a few criterias.
Uses public information about infrastructure, population and internet connexion.

The Python script is a streamlit app, see more here https://www.streamlit.io/

coordonnees.csv contains the lattitude and longitudes of cities in France
scores.csv contains a score between 1 and 5 for each criteria for each city.

The paths to the csvs need to be changed in the python script to run.

(Python code to create the scores will come next.)
